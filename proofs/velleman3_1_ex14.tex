Suppose $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Prove that if $x^2+y=-3$ and $2x-y=2$ then $x = -1$ \\*
\textbf{Proof.} \\*
Let name expression $x^2+y=-3$ as (1) and $2x-y=2$ as (2). (1) can be written as $y=-3-x^2$ and (2) multiply by $-1$ and write it as $y=2x-2$. We conclude that $-3-x^2=2x-2$. Now substitute $x$ with $-1$ and the expression becomes true.
